This is where I left off, we're ready to start working on the front end

## Commands
`$ npm run dev` [or `$ npm start`] (from main directory, not the ./server)
  you should see: "MongoDB Connected: ac-q8qeeeb-shard-00-02.ba3ggjc.mongodb.net"

## Notes
In order to access the Database, add an IP address that is accessable from anywhere
